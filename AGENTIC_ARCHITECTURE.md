# Agentic Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an agentic architecture for the Health Records Management System, converting it from a traditional LLM-driven application to a multi-agent framework using **LangGraph**.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Orchestrator Agent (`app/services/orchestrator_agent.py`)

The orchestrator agent is the central coordinator that:
- Analyzes user intent from natural language queries
- Selects appropriate tools/agents based on intent
- Executes workflows using LangGraph
- Generates comprehensive responses

#### Key Features:
- **State Management**: Uses `AgentState` to maintain context throughout the workflow
- **Intent Analysis**: Classifies user queries into specific intents
- **Tool Selection**: Maps intents to appropriate tools
- **Response Generation**: Creates comprehensive responses from tool results

### 2. Tool Definitions

The system includes several specialized tools that can be called by the orchestrator:

#### `get_medical_history_report`
- **Purpose**: Generate complete medical history reports
- **Parameters**: `user_id`, `date_from`, `date_to`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Retrieves all health records for a patient
  - Gathers all associated files
  - Generates comprehensive summaries
  - Returns structured data with counts and summaries

#### `query_medical_record`
- **Purpose**: Query specific medical records for detailed information
- **Parameters**: `health_record_id`, `user_id`, `query`
- **Functionality**:
  - Retrieves specific health record and associated files
  - Uses existing agent service for query processing
  - Returns detailed context and responses

#### `get_latest_prescription`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the most recent prescription for a patient
- **Parameters**: `user_id`
- **Functionality**:
  - Searches all health records for medications
  - Identifies the latest prescription by date
  - Includes medicine information from external sources
  - Returns prescription details and medicine info

#### `search_health_records`
- **Purpose**: Search across all health records and files
- **Parameters**: `query`, `user_id`, `user_type`
- **Functionality**:
  - Performs semantic search in health records
  - Searches file contents
  - Returns ranked results with counts

#### `generate_health_summary`
- **Purpose**: Generate comprehensive health summaries
- **Parameters**: `health_record_id`, `summary_type`
- **Functionality**:
  - Creates summaries for specific health records
  - Supports both layman and medical summaries
  - Includes file count and record information

### 3. LangGraph Workflow

The workflow follows this pattern:

```
User Query â†’ Intent Analysis â†’ Tool Selection â†’ Tool Execution â†’ Response Generation
```

#### Workflow Nodes:

1. **`analyze_intent`**: Classifies user intent using keyword matching
2. **`select_tools`**: Maps intents to appropriate tools
3. **`execute_tools`**: Runs the selected tools using LangGraph's ToolNode
4. **`generate_response`**: Creates final response from tool results

#### State Management:
- Uses `MemorySaver` for conversation memory
- Maintains context across multiple interactions
- Tracks tool results and confidence scores

## API Endpoints

### Orchestrator Endpoints (`/api/v1/orchestrator/`)

#### `POST /orchestrator/query`
Process natural language queries through the orchestrator agent.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "Give me my complete medical history report",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "user_type": "PATIENT",
  "health_record_id": "optional_record_id"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "ðŸ“‹ **Medical History Report Generated**\n\nFound 5 health records with 23 files.\n\n**Summary:** [Generated summary]",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "sources": ["health_records", "medical_database"],
  "suggested_actions": ["view_health_record", "schedule_appointment"],
  "cypher_queries_executed": []
}
```

#### `GET /orchestrator/tools`
Get list of available tools and their descriptions.

#### `GET /orchestrator/status`
Get orchestrator agent status and health information.

#### `POST /orchestrator/examples`
Get example queries that users can ask.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Complete Medical History Report
**User Query**: "Give me my complete medical history report"

**Workflow**:
1. Intent Analysis: `get_medical_history`
2. Tool Selection: `get_medical_history_report`
3. Tool Execution: Retrieves all records and files, generates summary
4. Response: Comprehensive report with counts and summaries

### 2. Latest Prescription
**User Query**: "What's my latest prescription?"

**Workflow**:
1. Intent Analysis: `get_latest_prescription`
2. Tool Selection: `get_latest_prescription`
3. Tool Execution: Finds latest medication, gets medicine info
4. Response: Prescription details with medicine information

### 3. Search Records
**User Query**: "Search for diabetes-related records"

**Workflow**:
1. Intent Analysis: `search_records`
2. Tool Selection: `search_health_records`
3. Tool Execution: Performs semantic search
4. Response: Search results with counts and relevance

### 4. Health Summary
**User Query**: "Generate a summary of my health record"

**Workflow**:
1. Intent Analysis: `generate_summary`
2. Tool Selection: `generate_health_summary`
3. Tool Execution: Creates comprehensive summary
4. Response: Layman and medical summaries
