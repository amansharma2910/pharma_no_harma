# Prompt Improvements for Better Patient Experience

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the AI prompts used throughout the Pharma No Harma application. The goal is to make medical information more accessible and user-friendly, especially for elderly patients with weak cognition and attention spans.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Layman Summaries (Patient-Friendly)

**Target Audience**: Elderly patients with weak cognition, limited attention span, and difficulty with medical jargon.

**Key Features**:
- **Simple Language**: Uses everyday words, avoids medical jargon
- **Short Sentences**: Keeps sentences under 15 words when possible
- **Clear Structure**: Main point first, then supporting details
- **Action-Oriented**: Tells patients exactly what to do next
- **Personal Tone**: Uses "you" and "your" to make it personal
- **Visual Formatting**: Bullet points, bold text for important items
- **Length Control**: Limited to 150 words for better attention span

**Example Transformation**:
```
Before: "Patient exhibits elevated blood pressure readings consistent with Stage 1 hypertension."
After: "Your blood pressure is higher than normal. This means your heart is working too hard."
```

### 2. Doctor Summaries (Clinical)

**Target Audience**: Healthcare professionals who need precise, actionable clinical information.

**Key Features**:
- **Critical Findings First**: Most urgent/important information highlighted
- **Precise Medical Language**: Correct medical terminology and ICD-10 codes
- **Structured Format**: Clear clinical headings and organization
- **Complete Information**: All relevant clinical details included
- **Actionable Next Steps**: Clear follow-up actions and monitoring requirements
- **Evidence-Based**: References to clinical guidelines when appropriate

**Example Structure**:
```
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Essential Hypertension (I10)
CRITICAL FINDINGS: BP 145-160/95-105 mmHg over 3 weeks
TREATMENT PLAN: Lifestyle modifications + medication review
FOLLOW-UP: BP monitoring in 2 weeks
```

### 3. Medicine Information (Patient Education)

**Target Audience**: Patients and family caregivers, especially elderly individuals.

**Key Features**:
- **Safety First**: Important warnings prominently displayed
- **Simple Instructions**: Step-by-step how to take medication
- **Clear Side Effects**: Most common side effects listed
- **Emergency Signs**: When to call doctor or 911
- **Storage Instructions**: Simple storage rules
